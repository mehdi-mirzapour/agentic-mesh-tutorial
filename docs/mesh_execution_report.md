# Mesh Execution Report - Agentic Mesh

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Test ID:** `report-doc-3`  
**Focus:** Tracing internal message flow and agent interactions within the Redis Streams "Mesh".

## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents the successful execution of a multi-agent document analysis task. The system demonstrated effective horizontal fan-out (Coordinator) and asynchronous aggregation (Aggregator), maintaining strict message reliability through Redis Consumer Group ACKing.

## 2. Interaction Timeline

### Phase 1: Ingestion & Coordination
The producer fragmented the document into two chunks (`p-SLU...` and `p-ceV...`). The **Coordinator** immediately fanned these out to domain-specific streams.

| Agent | Event | Message ID | Destination Streams |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coordinator** | Task Received | `1771597366760-0` | Grammar, Clarity, Tone, Structure |
| **Coordinator** | Fan-out Complete | - | 4 Parallel Tasks Created |
| **Coordinator** | ACK Confirmed | `1771597366760-0` | Task removed from input queue |

### Phase 2: Specialist Processing (Parallel)
Four independent agents processed the tasks simultaneously. The logs show non-blocking execution across different processes.

*   **Grammar Agent**: Detected syntax/spelling issues in Chunk 2.
*   **Clarity Agent**: Suggested readability improvements for Chunk 1.
*   **Tone Agent**: Evaluated the emotional resonance of the text.
*   **Structure Agent**: Validated header hierarchy and flow.

### Phase 3: Result Aggregation
The **Aggregator** acted as a central sink, collecting suggestions as they were produced. It does not wait for a specific order, ensuring the UI (or next stage) receives updates as fast as possible.

| Received From | Event | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `doc.suggestions.tone` | Received Insight | Pushed to `doc.review.summary` |
| `doc.suggestions.grammar` | Received Correction | Pushed to `doc.review.summary` |
| `doc.suggestions.clarity` | Received Tip | Pushed to `doc.review.summary` |
| `doc.suggestions.structure` | Received Note | Pushed to `doc.review.summary` |

## 3. System Health & Performance
*   **Latency**: The time from coordination to final aggregation for a chunk was < 2 seconds (simulated processing delay included).
*   **Reliability**: Every message was successfully ACKed. No messages entered the DLQ (Dead Letter Queue).
*   **Parallelism**: Specialist agents occupied separate CPU processes, verifying the "Agentic Mesh" principle of distributed compute.

## 4. Operational Notes
During this test run, a fix was applied to the `src/main.py` entrypoint to ensure compatibility with the macOS `spawn` multiprocessing start method. This ensures robust local development on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
